# Description
With Halloween season approaching, I've been seeing a lot of products related to this holiday arriving at grocery stores. Oreo cookies Halloween limited edition being one of the examples.  As someone who likes Oreo (and with a cat who has the same name), I want to develop this web app with interactive dashboard to compare this Halloween limited edition with other classic ones.

# Data Overview
Data is collected from popular grocery/drug stores (e.g. Target, Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, etc.) and aggregated on each type of Oreo cookie. Please reference the .csv file in the data folder.
